# Python-Techdegree-Project-05

 My fifth Python Project 

Description: This is my fifth python project. In this project I create a website using Flask, HTML,
CSS, SQLAlchemy and all python's skills. 

If you use this app and reset the database. The step to follow are the following: 

    1) Run the app called "add_old_projects.py" doing so you will add a list of previous projects to an empty database. 

    2) Then everything will be set and ready to run the main app called "app.py".

    3) Finally you just need to follow the instructions in the web to add, modify or delete projects. 


If you ask me what I've learned... I'd answer you that I've learned a lot. Now I feel very comfortable using python
I hardly make mistakes. I definitely gain experience managing databases and I reviewed my HTML and CSS skills. Lastly and 
very important I've learned how to use FLASK and coordinate all the different documents using FLASK
